# canada_provinces_game

This project uses turtle and the pandas library. The idea is: the user inputs the name of a province into a dialog box and then if it's correct,
that name will show on the map at the right coordinates. and for the provinces the user doesn't know, a csv file will be generate holding the 
values that were not input.

Some changes have to be made like getting a better map and with that the coordinates have to be changed.
